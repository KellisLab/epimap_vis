Code for the [interactive browser](https://cboix.shinyapps.io/epimap_vis/).

You can also run the browser on your computer with this repository, using the [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) library in R:

```R
# Install shiny
install.packages('shiny')

# Run app from github directly:
library(shiny)
runGitHub("epimap_vis", "cboix")
```

In addition, we have manuscript analysis code on github at [https://github.com/cboix/epimap_analysis](https://github.com/cboix/epimap_analysis)
